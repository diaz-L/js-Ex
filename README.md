##### Ex 1
Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns the factorial (recursive)

##### Ex 2
Given a list of numbers, return the sum of all odd numbers

##### Ex 3
Given the temperature in degree Celsius, write a function that convert to Fahrenheit (hint: F = t * 9/5 + 32)

##### Ex 4
Given a year, write a function that returns the century it is in. Guaranteed constraints 1 <= year <= 2030.

##### Ex 5
Create a function that returns 'true' if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false. Remove all alphanumberic
characters. Constraint to 1 <= palindrome <= 10^5.
(hint: A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, 
and spacing.)

##### Ex 6
Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.
Guaranteed constraints:
	2 ≤ numL.length ≤ 10,
 	-1000 ≤ numL[i] ≤ 1000.

##### Ex 7

Define an n-interesting polygon by finding the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side.
